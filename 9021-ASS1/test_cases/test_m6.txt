One day, you stumble upon a hidden village known only to the inhabitants as The Land of Truth and Deception. 
In this village, there are two types of people: Knights, who always tell the truth, and Knaves, who always lie. 
You encounter a group of villagers and decide to determine who is a Knight and who is a Knave.

Sir Alpha proclaims: "All of us are Knaves."   
"Exactly one of us is a Knight," retorts Sir Beta.
Sir Gamma whispers: "At least one of Sir Alpha and I is a Knave."                  
"At most one of Sir Beta and I is a Knight," claims Sir Delta.
Sir Epsilon says: "Exactly one of Sir Gamma, Sir Delta, and I is a Knight!"
"Sir Alpha or Sir Beta is a Knight," exclaims Sir Zeta.             
"Sir Gamma and Sir Delta are Knights," asserts Sir Eta.                   
What's your opinion?
