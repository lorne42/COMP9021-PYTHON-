Yesterday, I visited Sirs Ashe and Akali. I asked Sir Akali 
who he was, and he answered impatiently: 
"At most one of Sir Garen and Sir Darius is a Knight!"
 Then I met Sir Ashe who introduced me to his wife
and told me: "All of us are Knave."
 "Sir Darius is a Knave," whispered Sir Garen. 
Should I trust them?
