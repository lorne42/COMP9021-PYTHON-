I was wondering through the woods one day. I was wondering, wondering and 
wondering! Sirs Magnus and Hikaru was playing checkers! Whilst they 
were playing I overhead Sir Hikaru say, "I am a Knight!" Then I overhead
Sir Wesley whisper, "At most one of Sir Hikaru and I are Knaves". Confused, 
I wondered and wondered back into the woods. Who was correct I pondered to myself.
