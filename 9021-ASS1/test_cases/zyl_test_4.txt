Yesterday, I visited Sirs Ahri and Akali. I asked Sir Akali 
who he was, and he answered impatiently: 
"At least one of Sir Ahri and Sir Darius is a Knight!"
 Then I met Sir Ashe who introduced me to his wife
and told me: "Exactly one of Sir Darius and I is a Knave."
 "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Darius. 
Should I trust them?
