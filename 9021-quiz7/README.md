This code primarily generates a random 2D grid and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from a start point to an end point. The main functions are as follows:

Grid Generation:

Based on the user input for seed (seed), density (density), and grid size (dim), the program generates a random grid of size dim x dim. Each cell in the grid can either be passable (represented by 1) or blocked (represented by 0).
If the randomly generated number is less than the density, the cell is passable; otherwise, it is blocked.
Path Finding:

The user specifies the coordinates for the start and end points, and the program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to try to find a path from the start to the end. The search order is determined by the movement preferences provided by the user, such as up (⬆), right (⮕), down (⬇), and left (⬅).
The DFS algorithm recursively explores the grid from the current cell in the four possible directions (based on user preferences), marking visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
If a valid path is found, the program marks the path on the grid with different symbols to indicate movement directions (e.g., left, right, up, and down).
Displaying the Path:

If a valid path is found, the program outputs the length of the path and displays the entire path graphically. Cells on the path are marked with different colors or symbols, and the start and end points are specially marked.
If no path is found, the program prints a message indicating that there is no path connecting the start and end points.
Auxiliary Functions:

display_grid(): Displays the generated grid, with * representing passable cells and spaces representing blocked cells.
display_grid_unicode() and display_grid_with_path(): Display the grid using Unicode characters and show the final path graphically.
rewrite(): Once a path is found, it marks the cells along the path to indicate the movement directions.
map_value_to_character(): Maps different grid values to corresponding Unicode characters for better visualization of the path.
Summary:
The program uses DFS to search for a path between the start and end points in a randomly generated maze. It allows users to define the search order and graphically displays the result. If no path is found, it notifies the user that the path is not possible.
