## Written by *** for COMP9021

# Implements a function that computes the maximum
# number of primes within a window of a given size,
# the first of which starts from a given lower bound
# and the last of which ends at a given upper bound.
# For all windows that achieve that maximum number
# within the window; outputs those two primes
# from smallest to largest first primes.
# You can assume that the function will be called with
# size a strictly positive integer,
# lower_bound an integer at least equal to 2, and
# upper_bound an integer at least equal to lower_bound.
# The function won't be tested for values of upper_bound
# greater than 10,000,000.
